# Data Architecture and Workflow Design

## Overview

This document outlines the data architecture and workflow for our Big Data Analytics project focused on customer segmentation using the Online Retail dataset. The architecture is designed to showcase proficiency with Databricks, Apache Spark, and cloud data workflows in a realistic enterprise scenario.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Storage Layer
- **Raw Data Zone**: Initial landing zone for the raw Online Retail dataset (CSV format)
- **Processed Data Zone**: Storage for cleaned and transformed data
- **Curated Data Zone**: Storage for derived features, aggregations, and model results
- **Implementation**: AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage with Delta Lake format

### 2. Processing Layer
- **Databricks Workspace**: Primary environment for data processing and analytics
- **Apache Spark Clusters**: Distributed computing for data transformation and ML
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment

### 3. Visualization Layer
- **Databricks SQL**: For creating interactive dashboards
- **Alternative**: Integration with Power BI or Tableau for enterprise reporting

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Data Ingestion
- Load the Online Retail dataset into the Raw Data Zone
- Register the dataset in the Databricks catalog
- Set up automated data quality checks

### Stage 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handle missing values (particularly CustomerID)
- Remove duplicates and outliers
- Convert data types (e.g., proper datetime formatting)
- Create a cleaned dataset in Delta format

### Stage 3: Feature Engineering
- Calculate RFM metrics:
  - **Recency**: Days since last purchase
  - **Frequency**: Number of purchases
  - **Monetary**: Total spending
- Create additional features like average order value, product categories, etc.
- Store engineered features in the Curated Data Zone

### Stage 4: Customer Segmentation
- Apply K-means clustering to RFM features
- Use MLflow to track experiments with different parameters
- Evaluate clustering quality using silhouette score
- Save model and results

### Stage 5: Visualization & Insights
- Create interactive dashboards showing:
  - Customer segment distributions
  - Segment characteristics
  - Purchase patterns by segment
  - Geographic distribution of segments
- Generate actionable business insights

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Processing with Apache Spark
```python
# Example Spark code structure
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Create Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Customer Segmentation").getOrCreate()

# Load and transform data
retail_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/path/to/online_retail.csv")
```

### MLflow Integration
```python
# Example MLflow tracking
import mlflow
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

mlflow.set_experiment("Customer Segmentation")

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("num_clusters", num_clusters)
    
    # Train model
    kmeans = KMeans(k=num_clusters, seed=42)
    model = kmeans.fit(assembled_data)
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("silhouette", silhouette_score)
    
    # Save model
    mlflow.spark.log_model(model, "kmeans_model")
```

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale with increasing data volume:

1. **Partitioning Strategy**: Data will be partitioned by date to optimize query performance
2. **Compute Resources**: Databricks clusters will auto-scale based on workload
3. **Incremental Processing**: Design for incremental data updates rather than full reprocessing
4. **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed data will be cached for performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Automated checks for data completeness and accuracy
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track job execution times and resource utilization
3. **Model Drift Detection**: Monitor segmentation stability over time
4. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for pipeline failures or data quality issues

This architecture provides a robust foundation for implementing customer segmentation using RFM analysis on the Online Retail dataset, while showcasing best practices in big data processing with Databricks and Apache Spark.
