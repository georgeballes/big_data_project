# Enterprise Customer Segmentation: A Big Data Analytics Solution with Databricks and Apache Spark

## Introduction

In today's data-driven business landscape, understanding customer behavior is crucial for driving growth and maintaining competitive advantage. This technical blog presents a comprehensive Big Data Analytics solution that leverages Databricks, Apache Spark, and MLflow to implement customer segmentation for an online retail business.

The solution demonstrates how to process large-scale transaction data to derive actionable insights about customer behavior, segment customers based on their purchasing patterns, and generate strategic recommendations for targeted marketing campaigns. This project showcases proficiency with modern big data technologies and cloud data workflows that can scale to enterprise-level implementations.

## Business Problem

Online retailers collect vast amounts of transaction data, but often struggle to transform this raw data into actionable insights. Customer segmentation allows businesses to:

1. Identify high-value customers who contribute disproportionately to revenue
2. Recognize customers at risk of churning
3. Develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer groups
4. Optimize marketing spend by focusing on the most promising segments
5. Improve customer retention and lifetime value

This project implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a proven marketing technique that segments customers based on their purchasing behavior, combined with machine learning to identify natural customer groupings.

## Solution Architecture

The solution follows a modern data lakehouse architecture that combines the flexibility of data lakes with the data management capabilities of data warehouses:

### Key Components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Processes raw transaction data from the Online Retail dataset and loads it into the data lake.

2. **Data Lake**: Organizes data in three zones:
   - **Raw Zone**: Stores the original, unmodified data
   - **Processed Zone**: Contains cleaned and validated data
   - **Curated Zone**: Holds business-ready datasets including RFM metrics and customer segments

3. **Processing Layer**: Implements data transformation, RFM analysis, and machine learning:
   - Data cleaning and preparation
   - Feature engineering for RFM metrics
   - K-means clustering for customer segmentation

4. **MLflow Integration**: Provides experiment tracking and model management:
   - Logs hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts
   - Registers trained models
   - Enables model versioning and deployment

5. **Visualization Layer**: Creates interactive dashboards to present insights:
   - Sales trends analysis
   - Geographic distribution
   - Customer segment characteristics
   - Business recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Data Ingestion

The data ingestion pipeline loads the Online Retail dataset, which contains 541,909 transactions from a UK-based online retailer. The pipeline performs initial data quality checks, identifying missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

```python
# Sample code from data ingestion pipeline
def load_raw_data(file_path):
    """
    Load raw data from Excel file
    """
    print(f"Loading data from {file_path}...")
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
    print(f"Data loaded successfully with {df.shape[0]} rows and {df.shape[1]} columns.")
    return df

def perform_data_quality_checks(df):
    """
    Perform initial data quality checks
    """
    print("\n=== Data Quality Checks ===")
    
    # Check for missing values
    missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
    print("\nMissing values per column:")
    print(missing_values)
    
    # Check for duplicates
    duplicates = df.duplicated().sum()
    print(f"\nNumber of duplicate rows: {duplicates}")
    
    return df
```

Key findings from data quality checks:
- 135,080 transactions (24.93%) have missing CustomerID values
- 1,454 transactions have missing Description values
- 5,268 duplicate transactions were identified

### Data Transformation with Apache Spark

In a production environment, the data transformation would be implemented using Apache Spark on Databricks. The transformation pipeline calculates RFM metrics for each customer:

- **Recency**: Days since the customer's last purchase
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases made by the customer
- **Monetary**: Total amount spent by the customer

```python
# Spark implementation for RFM calculation
def calculate_rfm_spark(spark_df):
    # Calculate max date for recency
    max_date = spark_df.select(spark_max("InvoiceDate")).collect()[0][0]
    
    # Calculate RFM metrics
    rfm = spark_df.filter(col("CustomerID").isNotNull()) \
        .groupBy("CustomerID") \
        .agg(
            datediff(lit(max_date), spark_max("InvoiceDate")).alias("Recency"),
            count("InvoiceNo").alias("Frequency"),
            spark_sum("TotalAmount").alias("Monetary")
        )
    
    return rfm
```

The RFM analysis revealed significant variations in customer behavior:
- Recency ranged from 1 to 374 days
- Frequency ranged from 1 to 248 purchases
- Monetary value ranged from near-zero to $279,489

### Machine Learning Pipeline with MLflow

The ML pipeline uses K-means clustering to segment customers based on their RFM metrics. MLflow tracks experiments, logs parameters, metrics, and models:

```python
# K-means clustering with MLflow tracking
def train_kmeans_model(scaled_features, n_clusters):
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"kmeans_{n_clusters}_clusters"):
        # Log parameters
        mlflow.log_param("n_clusters", n_clusters)
        mlflow.log_param("algorithm", "k-means")
        mlflow.log_param("random_state", 42)
        
        # Train model
        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42, n_init=10)
        kmeans.fit(scaled_features)
        
        # Evaluate model
        cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_
        silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(scaled_features, cluster_labels)
        
        # Log metrics
        mlflow.log_metric("silhouette_score", silhouette_avg)
        mlflow.log_metric("inertia", kmeans.inertia_)
        
        # Log model
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(kmeans, "kmeans_model")
        
        return kmeans, cluster_labels
```

The optimal number of clusters was determined to be 3, with a silhouette score of 0.425, indicating good cluster separation. The three customer segments identified were:

1. **Champions (20.1%)**: Recent purchasers with high frequency and monetary value
2. **Regular Customers (56.4%)**: Customers with moderate recency, frequency, and monetary values
3. **Hibernating Customers (23.5%)**: Customers who haven't purchased in a long time

### Interactive Dashboard

The solution includes an interactive HTML dashboard that presents key insights and visualizations:

1. **Sales Trends**: Daily and monthly revenue trends, order counts, and customer acquisition
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Revenue, customer count, and average order value by country
3. **Customer Segments**: Cluster characteristics, RFM distributions, and segment analysis
